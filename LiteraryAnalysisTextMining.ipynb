    "##### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will conduct a comparative analysis of two significant literary works: \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen (fiction) and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" by Mary Wollstonecraft (nonfiction). Both texts engage deeply with themes of gender, society, and individual rights, making them ideal for exploring the differences in language, themes, and sentiment between fiction and nonfiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using text mining techniques, we will analyze how each genre approaches these themes, examining the stylistic and rhetorical differences that characterize fiction versus nonfiction. Our analysis will involve data cleaning, tokenization, and the application of descriptive statistics, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. By comparing these works, we aim to uncover the unique ways in which each genre communicates similar ideas, providing insights into the broader distinctions between fiction and nonfiction writing.\n"
